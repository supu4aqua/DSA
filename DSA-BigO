1. What is the Big O for this?
  1) Constant time O(1)
  2) Linear time O(n)

2. Even or odd
O(1) - Not dependend on the value of input. It will always take the same time

3. Are you here?
O(n^2)

4. Doubler
  O(n) - Depends on length of arrays

5. Naive search
  O(n)

6. Creating pairs:
  O(n^2)

7. Compute the sequence
Algorithm is adding consecutive numbers and pushing the result to new array
  O(n)

8. An efficient search
  O(logn)

9. Random element
  O(1)

10. What Am I?
  O(n)
